It's very easy.\r\n* Install *xbindkeys* using the following command:  \r\n`$ sudo apt-get install xbindkeys`\r\n* Next we have to create a configuration file for *xbindkeys* in the home directory  \r\n`$ xbindkeys --defaults > $HOME/.xbindkeysrc`  \r\nwhere $HOME referes to your home directory\r\n* Open the configuration file:  \r\n`$ nano .xbindkeysrc`\r\n* Add your configuration which is a pair of key and a command to execute on pressing that key.  \r\n```\r\n\"sudo backlight -u\"\r\n    Control + Right\r\n\"sudo backlight -d\"\r\n    Control + Left\r\n```  \r\n* Save the file and close it.\r\n* Run xbindkeys  \r\n`$ xbindkeys`\r\n* Now pressing *Control + Right* should increase the brightness and *Control + Right* decreases it.\r\n* To make *xbindkeys* stop listening to key presses:  \r\n`$ killall -HUP xbindkeys`\r\n\r\n##Devices\r\nChecked in Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit Linux on Dell Inspiron N4010. It will work in all Dell Inspirons I guess. About other laptops I don't know SORRY! \r\n\r\n###Author\r\n[Arunvel Sriram](http://github.com/arunvelsriram) \r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nEmail : arunvelsriram@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
